# google homepage
My first project in my journey trying to learn webdev
basic css/html recreation of Google homepage, functionality wasn't considered important,
just the aesthetics of it. 
I learnt the basics of flexbox and also gained confidence in my html/css + debugging skills.
Onto the next one!
